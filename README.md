# Aweb
A small modulair static website generator written in
posix shell. Shell scripts are used as templates and
only changed files are regenerated. There are currently
modules for template support, markdown, minify and
compression.

It is used to generate the [plabble.org](https://plabble.org) website.
See the plabble.org [repo](https://github.com/Job79/plabble.org) for example usage.
